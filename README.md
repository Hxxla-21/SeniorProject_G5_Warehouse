# SeniorProject_G5_Warehouse
This is a repository for the senior project of amazing group G5 under software engineering specialization.. 
this repository reviews our first project to build an effective warehouse management 
web application that allows organizations to control and manage warehouse operations from the 
time products or materials enter the warehouse until their exit. To build this system, we 
communicated with the warehouse administrator at KFSHRC and visited them more than once to 
understand the most important problems they face It consisted in frequent manual dealings with 
employees and also in entering data manually, and this makes things complicated and error-prone 
and the difficulty of managing and organizing the purchase of medical requests in terms of storage. 
We facilitated these processes by creating a system that helps speed up and facilitate the process 
of organizing data for each request in a more practical way. Transforming manual work into 
electronic work to become more advanced, productive, and accurate, by making the system allow 
users to access and exchange data and request materials in a smooth and more flexible way
